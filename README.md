# RainAlert

RainAlert is a website using an API showing real-time weather in France. This WebApp was developed with Webpack in HTML/CSS/JS. This project has not been finalized, so it is not fully responsive.

The API I used for this WebApp : <a href="https://api.meteo-concept.com/">Meteo-concept</a>
